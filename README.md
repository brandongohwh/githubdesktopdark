# Github Desktop Dark Theme
As the name suggests, this will complement the existing Github Desktop to implement a dark theme. Did this on some spare time and because the interface was too bright to use at night.
# Instructions
Copy the lines to the bottom of your ui.css file. DO NOT OVERWRITE ANY LINE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY IN THE FILE.

For Windows, the ui.css file can be found in `%localappdata%\GitHubDesktop\app-<version number>\resources`
